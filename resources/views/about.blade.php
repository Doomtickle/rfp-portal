                <hr>
                <p>At KMA our goal in the media management process is to be effective
                    and efficient for our clients and YOU, or media partners.
                </p>
                <p>Our new Media Purchasing Portal allows us to receive proposals in a
                    consistent format from all vendors for the fastest possible review and reply.
                </p>
                <p>We have researched to purchasing software programs from Walmart and others
                    for best practices and our in-house developers have spent a considerable
                    amount of time creating a system to segment media categories, demographics,
                    day-parting and more.
                </p>
                <p>When you transmit your proposal it will be with the utmost security that only
                    KMA will access. This dashboard is only available through a secure http connection
                    (HTTPS).  All users are authenticated via a valid email address before being authorized
                    access to the system. Passwords and any personal identification are encrypted by a
                    block cipher and then hashed by a base-64-encoded value before being salted and stored in
                    our database; i.e. we are securing information in the same way that Facebook, Google, LinkedIn
                    and many other industry leaders choose to secure their data. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    All proposal content will be logged in your account and allow for the fastest possible
                    contract renewals
                </p>
